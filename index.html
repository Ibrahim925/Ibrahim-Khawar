						Ibrahim Khawar.
					</p>
					<p class="opacity-80">Nice to meet you :)</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						I'm a 17-year-old high schooler at
						<a
							href="https://www.hsc.on.ca"
							target="_blank"
							class="text-blue-900 hover:underline"
							>Hillfield Strathallan College</a
						>, born and raised in Toronto. I'm on a mission to
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							radically improve healthcare and transportation
							across the globe.
						</span>
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						I envision a world where
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							autonomous vehicles communicate seamlessly</span
						>
						with each other and their surroundings, eradicating
						motor accidents, and where technology
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							empowers individuals with disabilities</span
						>
						to gain greater independence and control over their
						lives.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						When I was 14, I interned at LogiSense as a software
						engineer to
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							expose myself to the IoT industry</span
						>
						as my first foray into the world of wearable technology and connected autonomous
						cars.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						After this internship, I realized that data is the
						lifeblood of the technologies that would enable the
						future I envisioned.
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							This led me to create a tech startup called
							<a
								class="text-blue-900 hover:underline"
								href="https://www.tablingos.com"
								target="_blank"
								>Tablingos</a
							>.</span
						>
						The core product is a SaaS through which businesses can
						normalize and integrate their data, laying the
						groundwork for future data-reliant technologies. The
						company is now
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							backed by Microsoft.</span
						>
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						I also interned as a software engineer at
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							Nokia</span
						>. I gained first-hand experience with developing
						software to ensure network security and stability.
                        <!-- This was invaluable as secure, uninterrupted communication is
						essential for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and
						vehicle-to-everything (V2E) interactions. I was also
						inspired by Nokia's
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							<a
								class="text-blue-900 hover:underline"
								href="https://www.nokia.com/about-us/newsroom/articles/5g-steering-the-future-of-connected-cars/"
								target="_blank"
								>use of 5G to implement connected cars</a
							>.
						</span> -->
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						After this, I developed CarNet: a system that enables
						cars to broadcast their intended actions,
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							helping nearby vehicles respond proactively and
							reduce the risk of accident,</span
						>
						using what I had learned about IoT and real-time
						networks from my previous internships.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						I then began work at
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital</span
						>
						in Dr. Jan Andrysek's
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							<a
								class="text-blue-900 hover:underline"
								href="https://hollandbloorview.ca/research-education/bloorview-research-institute/research-centres-labs/propel-lab"
								target="_blank"
								>PROPEL Lab</a
							>.</span
						>
						With a team of PhD and Master's students, I conducted
						research, developed a patient-facing app, and worked on
						data processing algorithms.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						During this time, I separately created an IOS app called
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							Pocket Prosthetic.</span
						>
						The app uses an iPhone's LiDAR sensor to create 3D scans
						of a patient's residual limb which they can then send to
						their prosthetist. This allows anyone, anywhere to
						create and access high-quality custom prosthetics. The
						app was one of the winning projects at
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							Hack the 6ix, Toronto's largest hackathon.
						</span>
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						I'm more than excited for what's to come as I continue
						building, failing, learning, and iterating my way toward
						the future I envision.
					</p>

					<br />

					<p>
						Apart from that, I love learning languages (French and
						Arabic at the moment), reading and writing stories,
						poetry, photography, filmmaking, basketball, running,
						and swimming.
