				<p class="opacity-80">Making data clean and accessible</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						Data has revolutionized the world.</span
					>
					With the exponential growth of digital technology, we‚Äôre now
					able to obtain vast amounts of information in ways that were
					previously unimaginable. From the largest enterprises, down
					to the smallest startups,
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						everyone deals with data.</span
					>
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					This data is in constant motion between a distributed
					network of systems. For example, your business may own a
					sales portal where customers are able to purchase your
					products. Your sales would then need to be shared with your
					billing platform in order to charge these customers. A third
					service could then take this information and perform some
					financial reporting.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Data also needs to be migrated when changing systems. Let‚Äôs
					say you‚Äôre a grocery store using inventory management system
					A, but you heard inventory management system B is cheaper
					and has more features, so you‚Äôre looking to make the switch.
					In order to do this, however, you need to take all of your
					product data currently stored on system A and migrate it
					over to system B.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						These are core processes that are constantly taking
						place in our data-driven world.
					</span>
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Organizational data is almost always riddled with errors and
					inconsistencies between systems that reduce this valuable
					resource into nothing but pain and suffering. Every system
					has its own expectations of how its data has to be formatted
					and defined, and when these requirements aren‚Äôt met,
					disaster strikes. Projects are delayed and money is wasted.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Consider the common challenge of customer onboarding, which
					often involves dealing with headaches such as data format
					and quality issues. When these problems arise during the
					onboarding process, they can result in significant delays
					that stretch project timelines by several months, leading to
					wasted time and resources. Such challenges create
					unwarranted obstacles in providing a smooth customer
					experience.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						Global healthcare organizations are no better</span
					>, often consisting of various disjointed systems with
					different ways of storing patient information, ultimately
					leading to a failure to effectively share and streamline
					this data, literally endangering lives.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					This is frustrating, but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. What we need
					is a seamless way to validate, transform, and integrate
					today‚Äôs data between the systems that power our world in an
					efficient and automated manner.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					At Tablingos, I've built something that does that. My
					mission is to
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						pioneer innovative solutions that guarantee clean and
						useable data</span
					>, enabling people and businesses to prosper in a
					data-driven future.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Tablingos enables businesses to define validation and
					transformation rules for their data. Additionally, users
					will be able to upload their tabular data through the app
					(in the form of CSVs, TSVs, etc.), which will automatically
					transform and validate the data according to the defined
					rules.
				</p>
				<br />

				<p>
					Additional methods of inputting data, such as APIs, Webhook
					events, FTP, and S3 events, will be introduced to enhance
					the initial version beyond direct file uploading. Further
					improvements will also be made by adding support for
					additional forms of data, such as JSON, images, EEG, and
					more.

					The Future of Connected Autonomous Cars
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					Driving remains one of the most perilous activities, with
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>42,514 fatalities</span
					>
					reported in the US due to motor vehicle crashes in 2022.
					This high risk stems from the fact that drivers, whether
					human or automated, typically operate in isolation. They
					rely solely on their own senses and reactions, leading to
					delayed responses and increased accident rates.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					Consider the challenge of navigating around a slow-moving
					truck. Often, drivers must make split-second decisions
					without knowing the exact intentions of other road users,
					increasing the likelihood of collisions. Imagine if vehicles
					could share their plans and intentions with each other in
					real time. For instance, if a car planning to switch lanes
					could inform nearby vehicles, accidents could be prevented
					by allowing others to respond accordingly.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					This is the core idea behind
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>CarNet</span
					>, a project designed to enhance autonomous driving through
					improved vehicle communication.
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>CarNet</span
					>
					aims to demonstrate how vehicles can publish their
					lane-change intentions and respond to messages from nearby
					devices.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					The
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>CarNet system</span
					>
					utilizes a
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>Sphero RVR robot</span
					>
					equipped with a smartphone to capture live video and follow
					a designated lane. The robot‚Äôs movement is guided by a
					custom algorithm that calculates deviation from the lane and
					adjusts its trajectory to stay on course.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					When encountering an obstacle, such as a pair of scissors,
					the robot broadcasts this event via a
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>bidirectional socket</span
					>
					to a laptop. The laptop then mimics the response of an
					oncoming vehicle, either allowing the robot to navigate
					around the obstacle or denying the maneuver if a collision
					is predicted.
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>object detection</span
					>
					is powered by a pre-trained YOLO model, which accurately
					classifies common objects to ensure reliable obstacle
					recognition.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					While the prototype uses
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>web sockets</span
					>
					for real-time communication, the long-term vision for
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>CarNet</span
					>
					includes implementing
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC)</span
					>
					combined with
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>GPS</span
					>. This approach would allow vehicles to share critical
					information only with nearby units, improving both safety
					and traffic efficiency.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>CarNet</span
					>
					represents a step toward a future where connected autonomous
					vehicles enhance road safety and streamline traffic flow,
					addressing the fundamental issue of
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md"
						>disconnected driving</span
					>.

					Pocket Prosthetic.
				</p>

				<p class="opacity-80">Democratizing Prosthetics</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					While working at Holland Bloorview, I learned about the
					prosthetic creation process. One of the most painstaking
					parts of this process was creating the mould or 3D
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						representation of the residual limb</span
					>. There were two key methods they went about doing this:
				</p>

				<br />

				<ol class="list-decimal ml-5">
					<li>
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							Fitting plaster around the patient's residual limbs:
						</span>
						This is a painstakingly long process and can be
						uncomfortable for the patient as it requires them to sit
						still for extended periods, which can be difficult for
						young patients and those with mental disabilities.
						Furthermore, the effectiveness of this method is
						dependent on the skill and precision of the moulder.
					</li>

					<br />

					<li>
						<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
							3D scanning:</span
						>
						While an improvement over the previous method, the
						IR/LiDAR scanners used for this process are expensive
						and hard to come by at a local hospital. Furthermore,
						many sensors flash lights at the patient which can be
						life-threatening for epileptic patients.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<br />

				<p>
					That's where
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						Pocket Prosthetic</span
					>
					comes in. My solution makes use of the LiDAR sensor
					available on most iPhones today. This app allows patients to
					submit LiDAR scans, images, and other necessary information
					defined by the clinic for their patient about their residual
					limb and prosthetic requirements directly from their phones.
					This data is sent to the clinic for prosthetic generation.
					This approach
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						significantly reduces the need for frequent clinic
						visits, making the process more accessible and
						convenient for patients,</span
					>
					especially those who live far from medical facilities.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					The app was developed using
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						Swift</span
					>
					for iOS, leveraging the LiDAR capabilities of modern iPhones
					to capture precise 3D models of the residual limb. The
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						TypeScript backend</span
					>
					is designed to handle the upload and processing of these
					scans, ensuring they are available to prosthetists for
					review and prosthetic design. The backend is hosted on
					<span class="font-mono bg-blue-100 px-1 rounded-md">
						AWS</span
					>, and all data is stored on S3 and MySQL.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					The app was one of the winning projects at
